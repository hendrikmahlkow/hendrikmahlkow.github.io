title: ""
With the knowledge gained through research, I do advisory work for policy makers and institutions, such as the ==European Commission==, ==European Parliament==, ==African Development Bank==, or local ministries, such as the ==German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs==, ==German Federal Foreign Office==, ==Austrian Ministry for Labour and Economy==. Dialogue with leading figures at the international, national, and regional level is aimed at incorporating socially relevant issues into my work and providing these actors with a sound informational basis for economic decision-making.
