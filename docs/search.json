    "text": "Research\nMy research focusses on international and environmental economics. I am using quantitative trade models based on the so-called gravity equation in order to derive numbers from theory. Therefore I link my educational background as an agricultural economist with my current work at the Trade Policy Task Force of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. For example, I use global gridded crop models to asses the impact of climate change on agricultural productivities and combine this with a gravity model in order to asses how different trade regimes can compensate negative welfare effects. Furthermore I am interested in econometrics of high-resolution and high-frequency data, e.g. remote sensing and spatial data.\n\nPublications\n\nCutting through the Value Chain: The Long-Run Effects of Decoupling the East from the West (with Gabriel Felbermayr and Alexander Sandkamp), Empirica, 2023.\n\n\n\nWorking Paper\n\nHow Trade Can Mitigate Climate Change Impacts, in progress.\nLong-Run Impacts of the Conflict in Ukraine on Food Security in Africa, in progress.\nThe Costs of War by Other Means (with Sonali Chowdhry, Julian Hinz, Katrin Kamin and Anna Jacobs), in progress."
