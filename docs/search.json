    "text": "Research\nMy research focusses on international and environmental economics. I am using quantitative trade models based on the so-called gravity equation in order to derive numbers from theory. Therefore I link my educational background as an agricultural economist with my current work at the ==Austrian Institute of Economic Research== and the ==Kiel Institute for the World Economy==. For example, I use global gridded crop models to asses the impact of climate change on agricultural productivities and combine this with a gravity model in order to asses how different trade regimes can compensate negative welfare effects. Furthermore I am interested in econometrics of high-resolution and high-frequency data, e.g. ==remote sensing== and ==spatial data==.\n\nPublications\n\nCutting through the Value Chain: The Long-Run Effects of Decoupling the East from the West (with Gabriel Felbermayr and Alexander Sandkamp), Empirica, 2023.\n\n\n\nWorking Paper\n\nThe Carbon Footprint of Global Trade Imbalances (with Joschka Wanner), CESifo, 2023.\nMacroeconomic structural change likely increases inequality in India more than climate policy (with Gabriel Felbermayr, Mathias Kalkuhl, Jan Steckel, Marian Leimbach, Michael Hübler, Lorenzo Montrone, Eduard Bukin, Johannes Koch, Marcos Marcolino, & Frank Pothen) Revise and resubmit at Environmental Research Letters.\nLong-Run Impacts of the Conflict in Ukraine on Food Security in Africa, (with Tobias Heidland and Sebastian Jävervall) submitted.\nClimate Change Adaptation: Agricultural Productivity Shocks and Trade Policy Responses, in progress."
