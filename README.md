[Creating your personal website using Quarto](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/)

- Editing the `index.qmd` YAML: you can apply a pre-built template to give your landing page a sleek and professional appearance (we can further modify this later with some CSS).
- Editing the `_quarto.yml` file – here we can easily update our top navigation bar (e.g. add new pages), add a page footer, a favicon, Google Analytics, declare a main font, and more. We can also switch the default theme to a different pre-built Bootswatch theme (by replacing cosmo with an alternative theme name).
- Defining CSS rules in the `styles.css` file that comes with every new Quarto site. This allows you to fine-tune the appearance of your site.
- Creating a `.scss` file(s) that contains Sass variables to quickly customize your website’s theme – these take the form of $var-name: value; and you can find a list of them in the Quarto documentation.
